Date Fields
==========

This New Zendesk app will allow you to simulate date fields using the standard Zendesk text fields. There are two settings:
* A multi line text field to place the field ID's you want to have as date fields. Use the field ID's separated by comma's ```123,456```
* The other is a checkbox that will hide the fields in the interface. The default is to disable the ability to edit the text fields. 

The fields are still text fields so you won't be able to use them in GoodData for data sorting.
